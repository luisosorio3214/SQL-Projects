<h1 align="center">Ben's Pizzeria Dashboard</h1>
<h1 align="center">Requirements</h1>

<p>
  <h3>Dashboard 1 - Order Activity:</h3>
  For this, we will need a dashboard with the following data:
  <ol>
    <li>Total Orders</li>
    <li>Total Sales</li>
    <li>Total Items</li>
    <li>Average Order Value</li>
    <li>Sales By Category</li>
    <li>Top Selling Items</li>
    <li>Orders By Hour</li>
    <li>Sales By Hour</li>
    <li>Order By Address</li>
    <li>Orders By Deliver/Pick Up</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Dashboard 2 – Inventory Management:</h3>
  This will be a lot more complicated than the orders. Mainly because we need to calculate how much inventory we’re using and then identify inventory that needs reordering. We   also want to calculate how much each pizza costs to make based on the cost of the ingredients so we can keep an eye on pricing and P/L. Here is what we need:
  <ol>
    <li>Total Quantity By Ingredients</li>
    <li>Total Cost of Ingredients</li>
    <li>Calculated Cost of Pizza</li>
    <li>Percentage Stock Remaining By Ingredients</li>
  </ol>

  
  <h3>Dashboard 3 – Staff:</h3>
  By far the simplest part of the requirements, we want to be able to monitor who was working on any given day or shift and what our overall staff costs are.
  <ol>
    <li>Total Staff Costs</li>
    <li>Total Hours Worked</li>
    <li>Hpurs Worked By Staff Member</li>
    <li>Cost Per Staff Member</li>
  </ol>
