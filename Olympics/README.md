<h1 align="center">120 Years of Olympic history: Athletes and Results</h1>
<h2 align="center">SQL Statements</h2>

<h3>Data Set Info:</h3>
Contains basic bio data on athletes and medal results from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.  The data set can be downloaded from Kaggle at this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results" target="_blank">link</a>.  Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four-year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.
