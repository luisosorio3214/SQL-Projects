# Structured Query Language - Projects
In this repository I used a combination of using Oracle MYSQL and Microsoft SQL Server

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>
  This Repository contains a list of projects where we used SQL to either explore, pull, or clean the data. Every project contains a list of requirements/statements required for 
  the particular project. In the <a href="https://github.com/luisosorio3214/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Olympics">Olympics History Project,</a> it provides a list of statements  
  that will challenge your SQL skills and require you to use advanced SQL syntax. In the <a href="https://github.com/luisosorio3214/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Ben's%20Pizzeria">Ben's 
  Pizzeria Project,</a> you will need to use SQL to pull specific data for the dashboard requirements. In the <a href="https://github.com/luisosorio3214/SQL- 
  Projects/tree/main/Bird%20Tracking">Bird Tracking Project,</a> you will pull specific data and then clean it using python to prepare it for a Tableau dashboard! See above for a 
  full list of projects.
