<h1 align="center">Bird Tracking</h1>



**Instructions**

For the second milestone project, you will be creating a dashboard that displays information about bird migration routes. 

This project will be split into three 
parts:

> **Part 1:** SQL and Databases

> **Part 2:** Data Wrangling

> **Part 3:** Visualizations

**Required Tools:** Google Colab, MySQL Workbench, Python, Tableau



**Background**

*Wings 4 Life* is a bird refuge organization that helps bird watchers plan bird-watching trips along migration routes on the southwestern coast of Europe and northwestern coast of Africa. 

It provides three different travel packages for tourists to choose from based on the locations they wish to visit and the types of birds they would like to see.

You will build a map of the best bird-watching sites for the three different traveler profiles listed below. The steps for Parts 1 and 2 are the same for all traveler profiles.

**The French Traveler**
* Only visits locations within or very near France
* Prefers high-speed bird sightings
* Hates cold weather

**The Retirement Getaway**
* Prefers to travel in the spring months
* Prefers birds that fly at low altitudes
* Willing to visit any location with mild weather (60sâ€“70s)

**The Loner**
* Prefers the early morning 
* Likes cool weather
* Looking for higher-altitude bird flights
